finsihed settings skeleton for settings tab.
must do:
- think of name for google extension
- make logo of some sort
- make settings tab appealable

must do after all functionalities are done
(or kapag ayaw ko muna magcode ng legit):
- make carousel slides on how to use the google extension

after settings tab:
- find out kung ano 'yung susunod na gagawin
- search on how to do the voice navigation
