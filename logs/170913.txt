Previous To Do's (from 170909 log):
must do after all functionalities are done
(or kapag ayaw ko muna magcode ng legit):
- make carousel slides on how to use the google extension
- think of name for google extension (update: "I See I Hear" is temp name)
- make logo (logo for the setting tab and the extension icon) of some sort (update: may naDL na ako na mata at mic)
- make settings tab appealable (appealable enough naman siya)

NEXT TO DO's:
- experiment with webspeech API
- find out the NEXT TO DOs
